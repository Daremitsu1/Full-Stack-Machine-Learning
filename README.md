## Full-Stack-Machine-Learning

Initially the jupyter notebook will show you how to:-
- How to work with data in Python
- Conduct exploratory analysis using the Pandas library
- Create stunning visualisations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

Next, we will:-
- Removing columns with pandas
- Cast columns to new data stypes using  df[col].astype()
- Identify and drop unneeded columns with df.drop()
- One-hot encode data using pd.get_dumimes()

Then, we will:-
- Train Python machine learning models with Scikit Learn
- Perform automated hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluate model performance with sklearn.metrics 

Finally, we will be: 
1. Saving models to Watson Machine Learning
2. Creating online  deployments with Python
3. Scoring our model using the Python API
